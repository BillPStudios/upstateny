Created by Bill Pytlovany located in Scotia, NY.  
I've had the honor to work with many talented programmers across the country from Redmond, WA to Dulles/Reston VA. My current focus is helping users maintain control of their computer by preventing malware and unwanted programs like toolbars. My age has allowed me to experience many changes in the industry but also presents a challenge to keep up and choose which new technology will actually stick around.
